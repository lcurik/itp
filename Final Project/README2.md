##Final Project Documentation
As I stated in the proposal, for the final project I decided to work on my Portfolio Website.
I started by using a template from the provided HTML examples that are linked in the class repository.
As I first started I had no idea what to look at and where to start, so I began to try to find recurring patterns and do my best to understand how the code was working.
To understand it was the easy part, then with the help of ChatGpt I began writing the code so that I could improve or change the website as I needed, without encessarily learning all HTML language and rules for it to function.
From then on i was a straightforward process in which I would ask ChatGpt specifically what I needed, provide it with my CSS, HTML and JavaScript, and the platform would give me back the code that I needed to paste.
Constantly I was in the need to make lots of corrections that where mainly involved in the page layout, size, shapes and colors.
There where two main issues during this process. One that I was able to fix and the other still remains unfixed.
The first one was embedding the spotify players inside the website, and make them look organized in both large and small screens. The sizes of the players would constantly change and they were almost never in the right place. After a long back and forth with ChatGPT I was able to fix it and now they work fine.
The second issue involved creating a dropdown menu for small screens that would help navigate between sections. I did my best but I could never get it to work or to be positioned in the right spot without messing with the website layout. I tried for a long time with different code structures but I was unable to get it to work
Apart from that, I am happy with the website structure and I believe it functions and aesthetically looks good.
