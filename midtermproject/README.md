# MIDTERM PROJECT
For this assignment first I began using the code that we all wrote / read together in class. The code structure is found inside the "05Functions" folder of the class repository.
## code reference
[Code Reference](https://github.com/rdwrome/261sp25/blob/main/05Functions/codealong.js)
The first thing I did was to add more sound to the code. I began by writing let mysecondsound and third sound but then realized I also needed to specify the sounds in the preload area. After that I decided which keys I wanted to use and went ahead and wrote the code for them.
In this part of the process I began by trying the function if for each specific key, but realized I needed to use the function "else if".
Apart from that, the process was straight forward.
