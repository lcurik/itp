# JavaScriptReading
## Chapter 1
1) I was aware that computers used binary numbers and so I assumed that Java Script also did
2) I did not know how to read binary numbers and after this chapter and some basic mental exercises I began to understand it's structure
### Chapter 2
1) From this chapter on, if Im honest I knew basically nothing. However, I felt that the strcture of coding at this level reminded me a lot of how microsoft excel works.
2) I did not know what functions, expressions, memory and bindings meant
#### Chapter 3
All the information in this chapter was new to me. It was really hard to understand and grasp all this information without context or any practical exercises. There's a lot of keywords and expressions that need to be integrated in order to understand whats going on. In my opinion the writer lacks a better introduction and explanation of the concepts presented. It feels like they assume that anyone who reads it is experienced in the world of coding. Throughout most of this chapter I had to integrate the help of ChatGPT in order to understand the terminology and the coding examples.
