##FizzBuzz
1) Opened terminal and Text Mate
2) Created subfolder called FizzBuzz inside itp
3) Wrote code sketch using class notes
4) Encountered a few different spelling mistakes for which I used chat gpt for their correction:

FIRST CODE ATTEMPT: 
for (let i=1;i<=100;i++){if(i%3===0)console.log("Fizz");}if(i%5===0)console.log("Buzz"); else {console.log("FizzBUzz");}

MISTAKES:
- Incorrect placement of if(i%5===0) condition
- Missing condition for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5
- Incorrect else block
