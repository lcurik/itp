# Markdown File For IN CLASS PROJECT

## Lorenzo Curik

- We started the project with deciding what we wanted the band to be like, deciding on the information of members, name of the band, etc.

- After that we used basic html assets as body, h, h3,p, b; to organize the text inside the website.

- We created a hyperlink that directly playsback music from spotify(we did this with the help of Chat Gpt)

- Instead of using a CSS file, we wrote directly the styling description for he website inside the HTML file, using "style" ;

- The hardest part was to get the background image to fit and cover the entire screen. For that we had to specify that the image does not repeat, and set the specific size in px for the image.

- Finally we added the image to our repository, referenced it with an internal URL to our "Images" folder inside the repository.

- For the website to be able to appear online, we just had to push the repository through GitHub
